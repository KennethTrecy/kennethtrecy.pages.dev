		<SimpleText itemprop="description">
			To ensure the quality of software builds, <Keyword>continuous integration</Keyword> has been practiced to <Citation info={references[0]}>guarantee that a developer's commit does not introduce errors</Citation>. Bugs, errors, or other glitches would be likely to occur in software development, particularly on new untested code. Therefore, detecting these mistakes early are crucial to maintain usability and reliability.
		</SimpleText>
		<SimpleText>
			One particular example is <Citation info={references[1]} itemprop="exampleOfWork">this website itself</Citation> which employs continuous integration to run different tests such as unit tests. Some of these tests check for grammatical errors in the text content of different pages.
		</SimpleText>
		<SimpleText>
			The reason is that grammar is particularly important in formal contexts. Even in informal context, having a good grammar helps the writer to convey the ideas correctly. It is even recommended by a search engine to <Citation info={references[2]}>avoid mistakes in grammar or spellings</Citation>.
		</SimpleText>
	</StructuredSection>
	<StructuredSection itemtype="https://schema.org/TechArticle" id={prerequisites.id}>
		<link itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" href={`#${pageMeta.pageURL}`}/>
		<SecondaryHeading headingInfo={prerequisites}/>
		<SimpleText>
			The readers of this article are expected to have <span itemprop="proficiencyLevel">intermediate</span> knowledge in JavaScript yet may be a beginner in employing continuous integration. They are also assumed to have knowledge in using Node.js <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> to install packages or run scripts.
		</SimpleText>
		<SimpleText itemprop="dependencies">
			Additionally, it is encouraged (but not required) to have a sample website to follow the steps and have a hands-on experience. Should the reader opt to do a hands-on, the website may even have a single page only for simplicity.
		</SimpleText>
	</StructuredSection>
	<StructuredSection id={localSetup.id}>
		<SecondaryHeading headingInfo={localSetup}/>
		<SimpleText>
			The steps below assumes that there is a website, real or hypothetical, that would be checked for its grammar.
		</SimpleText>
		<StructuredList order="ascending">
			<meta itemprop="numberOfItems" content={`${setupSteps.length}`}>
			{#each setupSteps as step}

		</StructuredList>

	<StructuredSection id={setupSteps[0].id}>
		<TertiaryHeading headingInfo={setupSteps[0]}/>
		<SimpleText>
			The first step is dependent on the reader's Node.js environment version. Regardless of the version, the package to be installed locally provides methods to request to a <Citation info={references[3]}>LanguageTool server</Citation>.
		</SimpleText>
		{#each installRequiredPackageCommandInfos as commandInfoSet}
			<ExampleCommand commandInfos={commandInfoSet}/>
		{/each}
	</StructuredSection>
	<StructuredSection id={setupSteps[1].id}>
		<TertiaryHeading headingInfo={setupSteps[1]}/>
		<SimpleText>
			The second step is to set up the E2E testing framework to be used. For this guide, <Citation info={references[4]}>Playwright package</Citation> would be used. The readers may choose their preferred framework to scrape the contents of the website as long as they could request through the package from the <Bookmark
				itemprop="citation"
				fragment={`#${setupSteps[0].id}`}>first step</Bookmark>.
		</SimpleText>
		<ExampleCommand commandInfos={installOptionalPackageCommandInfo}/>
		<SimpleText>
			If the reader chose <Citation info={references[4]}>Playwright package</Citation>, use the following configuration below and save it as <em>playwright.config.ts</em> in the project root. Note that <code>npm run preview</code> would run HTTP server bound on a certain port. In the configuration below, it requires the server should be found on port 4173. The readers may customize the command and port according to their setup.
		</SimpleText>
		<ExampleCode codeInfo={loadedFileInfos[0]}/>
	</StructuredSection>
	<StructuredSection id={workflowConfiguration.id}>
		<SecondaryHeading headingInfo={workflowConfiguration}/>
		<SimpleText>
			Copy the code below and paste it a file under <em>.github/workflows</em> from the project root. The readers may name it whatever they like.
		</SimpleText>
		<ExampleCode codeInfo={loadedFileInfos[1]} endLineIndex={38}/>
		<SimpleText>
			On lines 30 – 31, it double-checks if the <Citation info={references[3]}>LanguageTool server</Citation> is not yet running. After that, the lines 34 – 35, explicitly starts it. The line 36 – 37 just confirms if the server is running. The grammar-checking activity starts at line 38.
		</SimpleText>
	</StructuredSection>
	<StructuredSection id={execution.id}>
		<SecondaryHeading headingInfo={execution}/>
		<SimpleText>
			Below is a sample test code of a grammar-checking activity. It should be in a file placed under <em>t/e2e</em> from the project root. It may be improved upon depending on the reader's use case, situation, or goal. Next to test code is the explanation or the idea behind the test code, regardless whether the reader chose <Citation info={references[4]}>Playwright package</Citation> or not.

					Line 5 visits the page. This selects the page to be scanned for texts.
				</LabeledThing>
			</StructuredListItem>
			<StructuredListItem>
				<LabeledThing label="Extraction Step">
					Line 7 searches for all of the paragraphs found on the visited page. After that, all texts of the paragraphs would be extracted.
				</LabeledThing>
			</StructuredListItem>
			<StructuredListItem>
				<LabeledThing label="Analysis Step">
					Lines 9 - 18 send the extracted texts to the server for checking. This is the core step. Each result should return an empty array signifying that there that the checked paragraph is correct and free from errors.
				</LabeledThing>
			</StructuredListItem>
			<StructuredListItem>
				<LabeledThing label="Review Step">
					After getting all results of checking, line 22 expects that each result is an empty array.
				</LabeledThing>
			</StructuredListItem>
		</StructuredList>
		<SimpleText>
			After creating a test code, push the changes to a remote repository. The reader should check the "Actions" tab of the remote repository to see if the grammar checking tests work properly. If not, the mismatches would be shown by the chosen testing framework.
		</SimpleText>
		<SimpleText>
			Below is a snapshot of previous results of successful grammar check using the <Citation info={references[4]}>Playwright package</Citation>. Note that the presentation of results may vary per framework used for testing.

	<StructuredSection id={summary.id}>
		<SecondaryHeading headingInfo={summary}/>
		<SimpleText>
			Good grammar is important both in formal and informal contexts, as it helps convey ideas correctly and is recommended by search engines. By utilizing continuous integration, grammatical errors can be caught early in the development before publishing document, article, or any group of texts.
		</SimpleText>
		<SimpleText>
			The testing framework to be used is wholly dependent on the current progress in the system development, preferences, and other factors. It recommended having unanimous decision for ease and fast progress of development.
		</SimpleText>
		<SimpleText>
			Regardless of the framework, this article has presented a pattern to conduct grammar checks. The reader may even request directly to the API of <Citation info={references[3]}>LanguageTool server</Citation> if they know how to translate the code according to their chosen technologies and programming language.
